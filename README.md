Sup! Nice to see you on my GitHub Page üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Quick summery of myself:  
‚ùñ Primary Java Developer  
‚ùñ Working at [@CHECK24](https://github.com/CHECK24) in Munich  
‚ùñ Spare time project(s): DevOps at [@greeveu](https://github.com/greeveu)

If you are interested in projects I have been involved in, you can either look at some on my GitHub page directly or take a look at my main project [@greeveu](https://github.com/greeveu). I am responsible for developing and managing most of the software projects and servers. But please keep in mind that many of the projects I developed for Greev are closed source.
